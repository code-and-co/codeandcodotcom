					<p>Digitization of the OOH market will have considerable implications on the industry's future potential. It will lead to personalization, smart targeting with less spreading losses as well as allow real-time interactions and data-driven predictions – but also face questions of privacy and potentially new competition. </p>
					<p>We helped It Works Group identify new solutions, prototype them, and develop a digital roadmap to diversify its offerings and services – embracing the tide shift of digitization.</p>
					<p>In 2017 It Works Group was acquired by a private equity firm that strongly believed in the growth potential of the digital roadmap. </p>
