					<p>ShapeShift is the leading instant digital asset exchange, supporting dozens of blockchain tokens including Bitcoin and Ethereum. The company offers global trading of a variety of digital assets via web and mobile platforms.</p>
					<p>We were hired to perform a Technical &amp; Product Due Diligence to assess the products, code, team, and potential leading up to a Series A funding round of $10m.</p>
					<p>The fresh capital will be used to expand the exchange's engineering team and to continue the startup's impressive growth path – platform growth has averaged 48% per month in the last three years, seeing an average monthly trade volume of about 50,000 bitcoins spread across 40 digital currencies and assets.</p>
